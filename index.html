        <ul>
          <li>40% of survey respondents have a mental disorder</li>

        <p>
          575 people out of the 1433 respondents say they
          currently have a mental disorder. This is 40% of the survey population.
          Of the 287 people who answered the next question, 71% say that their mental
          disorder affects their productivity. Obviously, this is something that
          companies should address, for both altruistic and business reasons.

      <h2>Role of Tech Companies in Mental Health Issues</h2>
      <div class="info">
        <ul>
          <li>Only 46% of respondents know that they have coverage for mental health</li>
          <li>54% of respondents have either seen or experienced a negative response
              to mental health issues </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Companies can play either a positive or a negative role in the mental
          health of their employees. For example, by providing insurance that
          covers mental health concerns as well as physical health issues, companies
          can encourage employees to get treatment if necessary.
          <br>
          On the other hand, companies that discourage taking days off for mental
          health, discourage communication, and don't provide mental
          health benefits can have a detrimental affect on the mental health of
          their employees.
          <br>
          As you can see from the graphs, under half of survey respondents knew
          that their insurance covered mental health benefits, and responses were
          very mixed regarding whether employees felt that they could take
          time off without repercussions.

      <h2>Best Ways for Companies to Help</h2>
      <div class="info">
        <div id="data">
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            This dataset contains information on the respondent's mental health and
             the attitudes of their company to mental health issues. Using this
             information, my goal is to determine what a company can do in order to
             encourage employees to get treatment.
             <br>
             To do this, I built a classification tree with "Treatment" as a response,
             and figured out which factors best determined if a person with a mental
             health disorder was receiving treatment.
          </p>
          <h3>Data & Methods</h3>
          <p>
            I used Python and the sklearn library to clean and analyze the data.
            First, I read in the CSV file I'd gotten from Kaggle, then I cleaned up the
            data by removing unnecessary rows and changing the types of the variables from
            object to category. Since my goal is to predict when people with mental
            health disorders get treatment, I also removed all the rows where the
            respondent does not have a mental disorder.
            <br>
            Next, I removed the columns where over 400 people did not respond to the
            question. Then, I removed any rows left with NaN values. At this point,
            I have a data set with 381 responses, all with a mental health disorder,
            and no NaN values.
            <br>
            Then I turned the categorical variables into binary variables using one-hot
            encoding because Python's decision tree method only takes numerical values.
            One-hot encoding does not impose ordering on the data.
            <br>
            Lastly, I created the decision tree with a max depth of 6 and displayed the
            results.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="results">
          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>
            However, the six level tree didn't isolate what the most important
            factors were in encouraging someone to get treatment.
            So I modified the code and created a tree
            with only three levels, to better identify the main factors.
            <br>
            The resulting tree is displayed below. Click to enlarge.
            <a href="images/smallGraph.svg">
              <img src="images/smallGraph.svg" alt="" id="image1">
            </a>
            The most determinative factor seems to be whether or not the
            individual is diagnosed, which makes sense. Of those not diagnosed,
            only 14% are receiving treatment, even though all said that they
            had a mental disorder.
            <br>
            Beyond that, the most important factors are whether the individual has
            resources to learn about mental health concerns and options for seeking
            help, and whether the individual believes that their coworkers would
            view them differently because of their mental health issues.
            <br>
            The three level tree correctly classified 86.7% of responses and, when
            split into a training set and a test set, could predict "Treatment" with
            91% accuracy.
            The six level tree correctly classified 91% of responses and predicted
            "Treatment" with 93% accuracy. 
          </p>

          <br>
        <div id="conclusions">
          <h3>Conclusions & Future Work</h3>
          <p>
            Besides a diagnosis, the factors that are most important are having
            resources, and having supportive coworkers. For companies, the take
            aways from this should be to encourage employees not to judge others
            for any mental health disorders, and to provide resources in the form
            of both insurance and information.
            <br>
            If I had more time, I would definitely try the same analysis in R.
            The function that creates a decision tree in Python does not accept
            categorical variables, so the results were harder to interpret than
            I wanted.
            <br>
            I also think that the results would be more meaningful if there was a
            better way to deal with the fact that many questions had about five
            possible responses. I think this muddled the tree and made it harder
            to interpret.
            <br>
            When the data was split into a training and a test set, a six layer
            tree had a 93% accuracy rate for determining whether an individual
            received treatment. This indicates that there are universal factors
            that can help encourage good mental health practices. Hopefully the
            survey by OSMI and research done with the resulting data helps to
            inform companies about good mental health policies.
