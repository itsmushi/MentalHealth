      <h2>Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders in Tech</h2>
      <div class="info">
        <ul>
          <li>40% of survey respondants have a mental disorder</li>
          <li>71% who responded said that their mental disorder affects their productivity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          575 people out of the 1433 who answered this question say they
          currently having a mental disorder. This is 40% of the survey population.
          All of these people are employed, most at technology companies. Of the
          287 people who answered the next question, 204 say that their mental
          disorder affects their productivity. Obviously, this is something that
          companies should address, for both altruistic reasons and practical ones.

      <h2>Role of Tech Companies in Mental Health Issues</h2>
      <div class="info">
        <p>
          Companies can play either a positive or a negative role in the mental
          health of their employees. For example, by providing insurance that
          covers mental health issues as well as physical health issues, companies
          can encourage employees to get treatment if necessary.
          <br>
          On the other hand, companies that discourage taking days off for mental
          health issues, discourage communication, and don't provide mental
          health benefits can have a detrimental affect on the mental health of
          their employees.
          <br>
          As you can see from the graphs, under half of survey respondents knew
          that their insurance covered mental health benefits, and responses were
          very mixed regarding whether respondents felt that they could take
          time off without repercussions.
