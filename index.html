          <h2>Prevalence of Mental Health Disorders in Tech</h2>
          <p>
            575 people out of the 1433 who answered this question say they
            currently having a mental disorder. This is 40% of the survey population.
            All of these people are employed, most at technology companies. Of the
            287 people who answered the next question, 204 say that their mental
            disorder affects their productivity. Obviously, this is something that
            companies should address, for both altruistic reasons and practical ones.
