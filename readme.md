This is the final project for SDS 136 and 293. It is a visualization project followed by machine learning analysis of a dataset on mental health, specifically in tech.

## Analysis

The analysis section of the project is for SDS 293, Machine Learning. There is a
jupyter notebook in the analysis folder, as well as a summary of the results (in
progress) on the website.
I used Python and sklearn to build a decision tree with "Treatment" as the response
variable in order to determine the factors that lead a person with a mental health
disorder to get treatment.
